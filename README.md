# University of Leeds - Individual Project 2018/2019
The project is about Procedural Modelling of Virtual Cities. It will encompass modelling of streets (straight and curved), junctions (with rounded corners), building areas (the regions bounded by the streets), and buildings.

The project aims to produce a procedural approach of modelling cities primarily focuses on street generation and secondarily on building architecture. To increase the user experience, diverse input and output options are be provided as well as a real-time editing functionality. Users are able to provide real geographic data that will be used to automatically model a city. The resulting models have the option to be either visualised in OpenGL or exported as an OBJ file.
